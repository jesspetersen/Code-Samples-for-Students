#A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.

#You can access the list items by referring the index number.
print(f'This is the second item of the list: {fruit_list[1]}\n')

#You can use negative indexing
#Negative indexing means beginning from the end. -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
print(f'This is the last item of the list: {fruit_list[-1]}\n')

#You can adds elements at the end of the list with the method "append".

#You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.

#To change the value of a specific item, you can refer to the index number and set a new value.

#You can check if the item is present in the list.
if 'orange' in fruit_list:

# You can remove an item from the list by its value.
fruit_list.remove("melon")
print(f'Now the list has no melon: {fruit_list}\n')

# You can remove an item from the list by its index.
fruit_list.pop(0)

# You can also remove an item from the list by its index using the del method.
del fruit_list[1]

#The split() method splits a string into a list.
meat_list ="pork,bacon,ham,hot dogs".split(',')

#you can join two list.
food_list = fruit_list + meat_list

# You can also add one list to another
#Lists can have duplicate values
salad_list = ['carrots', 'broccoli', 'spinach', 'carrots']

#VocÃª tambem pode ordenar uma lista
food_list.sort()
