Pandas : Pandas is yet another Python library which is again not a part of the Standard Library and therefore requires installation.

Pandas is the most widely used tool for data munging. It contains high-level data structures and manipulation tools designed to make data analysis fast and easy.

pip install pandas -> it is the command to install pandas onto system, when using linux.

Pandas provides a new datastructure called as 'Data Frames' which is multi-dimensional and can be imagined to be something similar to that of the tables in databases or a sheet in the Excel / Spreadsheets and are Highly Optimised.

DataFrame and Series : A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.

One column of a DataFrame = Series

=> Collection of Data of one Aspect = Series
&
=> Collection of Series of Multiple Aspects = DataFrame


Boolean Masks : Boolean Masks are sequences of True/False
